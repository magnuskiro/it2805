# What to put in beer?
Beer basically consists of four ingredients:

* [Yeast](#yeast "yeast")
* [Grain](#grain "grain")
* [Hops](#hops "hops")
* [Water](#water "water")

Those four things are all you need to make beer, but you can add all kinds of [other stuff](#other "other") as well if you want to experiment with different tastes.
