# About / readme

This site is the result of a project in the course IT2805 at NTNU. It has mainly been built using the [bootstrap framework](http://getbootstrap.com/ 'bootstrap').

The different subpages are mainly written in Markdown, and [pagedown](https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/ 'pagedown') is used to convert the markdown to HTML on the client side. There's also a little bit of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/ 'jquery') and a some kittens from [placekitten](http://www.placekitten.com 'placekitten').

There's some [handwritten CSS](../bootstrap/css/custom.css 'css') and the alcohol percentage and ingredients amount calculators have been written by us.

The sitemap is created with XML. We have eight different webpages on this site, not the required ten, since we decided to skip subpages (e.g. all ingredients are listed on one page, instead of a seperate sub-page for each). 

The site is not complete, and is still considered a work in progress. Some pages lack proper content and have only placeholder text and or images, but we figure this is okay since this isn't supposed to be about content, but about showing our ability to build webpages. We decided to use the frameworks and libraries mentioned earlier as a learning experience in order to try out popular web development technologies. We discovered that they allow rapid prototyping and development, but that it's not always easy to figure out how make pages look and behave as you want to.
