        <h2>Exercise 5</h2>
        Assignment 5: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
        Download 5.zip file.
        1. Fonts and colors (10%)
        Create an file named
        style.css
        . Copy your webpage from assignment 3.2.
        Now you’re going to change the fonts on the pages. Create
        style
        .css, link the
        stylesheet to the page and define the fonts. The body text should be in a serif
        font (like Georgia). The headings should be in a sans-serif font (like Helvetica).
        For any links, make the font style change when you hover over them.
        Since the fonts are installed locally, there is no guarantee that the font you would
        like to display is available. Due to this, it may be a good idea to prioritize what
        font you want to display, or what font family you want to use. You should also
        provide a fallback using the CSS default fonts (
        serif
        ,
        sans-serif
        , etc.).
        2. Practising CSS Positioning (15%)
        In the CSS presentation model, every displayable element is consid-
        ered to fall inside a rectangular box (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
        US/docs/Web/CSS/box_model). Each box has an external margin, a border,
        internal padding and content (e.g. text or images, etc.), as shown below.

        With the file
        positioning.html
        in 5.zip, write the CSS for the four
        div
        boxes
        seen in the
        body
        . Write it in the
        head
        section of the file. Make it look like
        little-boxes.jpg
        . The colors used for the boxes are
        #47ABDE
        and
        #9C8951
        .
        Hint:
        Use relative and absolute positioning consistently.
        3. Style a HTML files (15%)
        In this task, you’re going to style
        site.html
        (from 5.zip), and make it look like
        cssed.jpg
        .
        4 Consistent look and feel (30%)
        Copy your files from assignment 3.2. For this part you’ll add a style to all the
        files, and implement a two column layout, with the menu on the left side and
        the content in the middle. The header should consist of the title of the page.
        Also add a footer with information on the web developer (your name is enough).
        You’ll have to change the html files and add css tags.
        5 Same CSS, different HTML (30%)
        Copy four HTML files from your earlier assignments:
        aboutme.html (assignment 2)
        assignments.html (assignment 1)
        schedule.html (assignment 2)
        project.html (assignment 4)
        Make a set of CSS rules you can apply to the pages. You should use the same
        tags on all the pages to get the same look and feel.
        Instead of writing embedded or inline CSS, link all the pages to the same
        stylesheet. This way you only have to write the CSS once. Be sure to make a
        navigation bar at each page, with relative links to the other pages.
        The HTML files should be structured with these HTML5 tags
        <header>
            ,
            <nav>
                ,
                <section>
                    ,
                    <footer>
                        . You can read about them here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
                        US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list#Sections
                        It is possible to structure each section with it’s own header, section and footer
