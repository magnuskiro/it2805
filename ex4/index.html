        <h3>3. Project proposal</h3>
        <p>
        <h4>Primary Goal</h4>

        <h4>Pages of the project:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Home</li>
            <li>About</li>

            <li>HowTo Brew: a brewing tutorial</li>

            <li>Recipes</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic</li>
                <li>IPA</li>
                <li>Dry Sout</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Resources, places for further information</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        Fellow brewers and people that has not brewed before.
        Old browsers are not a major concern as we mostly focus on basic technology and well tested design.
        With basic frameworks we don't need to focus on device optimization.

        <h3>Multimedia content</h3>
        Some youtube videos and other images will be used. But this will be added as embedded html.
        So we don't need to think to much about the multimedia content.

        <h3>Interactions and Dynamic features</h3>
        Interesting features we think about are alcohol percentage calculators, and other simple calculations to setup your beer.
        If we have really good time we can add a recipes builder, so you can create your beer online before brewing it.

        <h3>Content</h3>
        As brewing is a hobby of ours we create the content our selves.

        <h3>What to learn from different sites</h3>
        Different sites like this are focused mostly in america so we should have a more national focus. And probably have content in norwegian.
